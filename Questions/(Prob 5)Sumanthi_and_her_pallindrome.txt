Checking if a given word is a palindrome is so old school and Sumathi gets bored with these kind of exercises by now. She wanted to check if the given word can be rearranged to become a palindrome. That is given a string, her task is to reorder its letters in such a way that the word becomes a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).

Input:
The only input line has a string of length n consisting of characters A–Z.

Output:
Print a palindrome consisting of the characters of the original string. 
You may print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
Example

Input:
AAAACACBA
BHANUU
YOPPO

Output:
AACABACAA
NO SOLUTION
