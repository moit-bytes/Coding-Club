[ Yours precisely, Sailaja. [Episode - 1] ]


During her school days Sailaja's teacher used to ridicule her interest in 
math and programming saying girls should stay away from these tough and intellectually 
challenging subjects. Instead of losing hope, she kept working on her passion 
independently not caring for the cultural bias around her.

As a college girl she is obsessed with numerical precision. She always believed 
precision is absolutely crucial when it comes to computations related to scientific 
experiments and also finance. For example she knew that every time a new particle is 
discovered in an accelerometer (in CERN for example), the numerical computations involve 
precisions of very very very high order. But most of these programming languages 
(including Python) don't support arbitrary precision. For instance in Python, if you do

>>> 1/246
It returns
>>> 0.0040650406504065045
But when you inverse this operation and do
>>> 1/0.0040650406504065045
It returns
>>> 245.99999999999997

This is the classic floating point round-off error. Sailaja does not like this. 
She wanted to build her own computer program that evaluates the decimal 
representation of the fraction X/Y up to a desired precision.

Input:
The input will consist of a set of triples of values for X, Y, P separated by commas.

Output:
The output evaluates X/Y with P digits after the decimal dot.

Constraints:
0 < X < 9223372036854775807;
0 < Y < 9223372036854775807;
0 < P < 1000000;
